# Regression-On-Earth-Surface-Temperature

This project uses dataset ["Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) found on Kaggle


Goes through the process of data cleaning and lastly regression to predict the temperature given year 
(Temp vs Time) 


A full conclusion of the project is included in the [Conclusion.pdf](https://github.com/Qz07/Regression-On-Earth-Surface-Temperature/blob/main/Conclusion.pdf) with findings and futher steps.
